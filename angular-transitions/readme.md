##Introduction

AngularJS allows usage of awesome transitions by using CSS3. All we need to do is to define these transitions and declare where and when we want to use them.
There are differences between the APIs in the different versions of AngularJS.
You can see how you can use them in [v1.4](http://code.angularjs.org/1.1.4/docs/api/ng.directive:ngAnimate), [1.1.5](http://code.angularjs.org/1.1.5/docs/api/ng.directive:ngAnimate) and [v1.2](http://www.yearofmoo.com/2013/08/remastered-animation-in-angularjs-1-2.html).

This repository contains a set of pre-defined AngularJS animations which you can just copy and paste in your project. Both 1.1.5 and 1.2 APIs are supported (so you can use them with ui-view too).
You can see a **[demo here](http://angular-transitions.mgechev.com/)**.

Some of the animations are inspired by [scroll.js](http://lab.hakim.se/scroll-effects/).
